# Contributor GitHub App

[‰∏≠ÊñáREADME](README_CN.md)

‚ú® Welcome to the Contributor GitHub App! ‚ú®

In a nutshell, to better manage projects, we need an enhanced Issue management tool. This is why I created this project.

ü§ñ By configuring bots with repository files, everyone can freely customize the bot. The bot will automatically handle
repository events based on the configuration file.

üêá This project was inspired by
the [https://github.com/coderabbitai/ai-pr-reviewer/](https://github.com/coderabbitai/ai-pr-reviewer/) project. However,
it's unfortunate that they have decided to close their repository and code. Using it requires additional payment, and
although payment is necessary, I don't like closed systems and monthly billing. I prefer open, pay-as-you-go (or
self-hosted) services.

üöÄ This repository includes a configuration file template, which you can use to set up your bot. Sensitive information
such as keys can be configured through my panel.

## How to Use

1. **Install the App**: Install the app to your repository.
2. **Get Repo Token**: Add apikeys and other sensitive information to
   the [Dashboard](https://contributor.dianas.cyou).
3. **Build the `.nerve.toml` File**: Create a configuration file based on the template. [Example](.nerve.toml)

> **Note**: The panel is only used to store API-related keys. You fill in the UUID to your repository, and GithubApp
> collaborates with the repository to finally obtain the customized configuration.

    participant User
    participant Dashboard
    participant Repository
    participant GithubApp
    participant Robot
    User ->> Dashboard: Provides sensitive information
    Dashboard ->> User: Returns UUID
    User ->> Repository: Provides UUID
    Repository ->> GithubApp: Provides UUID and requests operation
    GithubApp ->> Robot: Verifies repository with UUID
    Robot ->> GithubApp: Confirms repository validity
    GithubApp -->> Repository: Executes operation
```

## Custom Operations

Although the project may seem complex, adding new operations is actually quite simple. GitHub passes events through
webhooks, and we only need to handle these events and then execute our operations.

Please open the [main.py](main.py) file and add your custom operations.

Here is an example of a new listener:

```python
webhook_handler = ...
git_integration = ...
get_repo_setting = ...
logger = ...
from webhook.event.issue_comment import CreateIssueCommentEvent
from webhook.event_type import IssueComment


@webhook_handler.listen(IssueComment, action=IssueComment.CREATED, unique_id="uuid")
async def handle_issue_comment(event: CreateIssueCommentEvent):
    logger.info("Received IssueComment.CREATED event")
    repo_setting = get_repo_setting(
        repo_name=event.repository.full_name,
        repo=event.repository.get_repo(git_integration)
    )
    # repo_setting is the content of the .nerve.toml file
    issue = event.repository.get_issue(integration=git_integration, issue_number=event.issue.number)
    comment = issue.create_comment(f"Hello World!")
    issue.get_comment(comment.id).edit("Hello World! Edited")
    print(f"Issue: {event.issue.title}")
    print(f"Comment: {event.comment.body}")
    print(f"Repo: {event.repository.full_name}")
```

The same event can have multiple listeners, as long as each listener has a different `unique_id`.
