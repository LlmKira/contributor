## üöÄ Contributor GithubApp

In a nutshell, for better project management, we need an improved Issue management tool. That‚Äôs why I created this
project.

By configuring a bot through repository files, everyone can freely set up the bot through these files, which will
automatically handle repository events based on the configuration.

This repository includes a template configuration file for setting up your bot. As for sensitive information like keys,
you can easily configure them through my panel.
