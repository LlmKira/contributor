# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [LLMKIRA]. In order to clarify the intellectual property
license granted with contributions from any person or entity, [LLMKIRA] must have a Contributor License
Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each contributor. This license is for your protection as well as the
protection of [LLMKIRA] and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any
other purpose.

## Terms

### Grant of Rights

1. **License Grant**: You hereby grant to [LLMKIRA] a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,

   assert such rights against [LLMKIRA] or its sublicensees and you hereby waive such rights.

### Representations and Warranties

4. **Original Work**: You represent that each of your contributions is your original creation (see section 7 for
   submissions on behalf of others).
5. **No Infringement**: You represent that your contribution does not violate any third partyâ€™s rights. Additionally, if
   your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you represent that you have received permission to make
   contributions on behalf of that employer.

   under this CLA on behalf of the other individual or entity.

   guidelines, as they may be updated from time to time.

### Miscellaneous

8. **Governing Law**: This CLA shall be governed by the laws of [United States of America].
9. **Entire Agreement**: This CLA constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
   matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such
   subject matter.
10. **Severability**: If any provision of this CLA shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then
    that provision shall be deemed severable from this CLA and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any
    remaining provisions.
